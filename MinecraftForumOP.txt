UPDATED FOR MINECRAFT 1.5.2 (1.5.1)
Version 2.8.6
Requires: [url="http://www.minecraftforge.net/"]Forge[/url] [url="http://files.minecraftforge.net/"]7.8.0.684+[/url]
Tested with: [url="http://www.minecraftforge.net/"]Forge[/url] [url="http://files.minecraftforge.net/"]7.8.0.733[/url]

This Mod is the continuation of [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/1051245-eddiev/"]EddieV's[/url] mod. The original thread can be found [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/952372-chococraft-12-mc-11-chocobos-now-fly/"]here[/url]. I've officially taken over the helm with Eddie's kind blessings.

This mod adds a mob called Chocobo to the game. This includes different coloured mob types with different attributes in their grown-up and juvenile form.

The most basic type can be found in the wild and can be tamed by using "Gysahl Greens" on them. Gysahl Greens is a plant found in the wild, but also can be planted by sowing Gysahl Seeds. Gysahl Seeds can be received by crafting from Gysahl Greens or by harvesting planted Gysahl Greens.

Chocobos can be breed and procreate. The offspring will be a Chicobo, the juvenile form of a Chocobo. After a while a Chicobo will grow into a Chocobo. Chicobos will be born wild and have to be tamed. Chicobos will inherit the type from one of their parents or mutate into new types. Thus by repeatedly breeding Chocobos all normal types of Chocobos can be acquired from tamed wild Chocobos. There are a few special Chocobo types though, which can only be acquired by special means.

As of version 2.0.4 this mod is in working condition for SMP.

[color=#ff0000][b]ACHTUNG! CAUTION! ¡CUIDADO! चेतावनी! ATTENZIONE! береги́сь!
This version of Chococraft is not compatible to versions pre 2.0.0 (pre mc 1.3.2). It will destroy your saved world if old Chocobos are included. Thus, if you want to use an old world with the new version of this mod, you should first start minecraft without the Chococraft mod, enter and save your world, thus removing all traces of older versions of Chococraft and only then start minecraft with the new version of Chococraft and tame new Chocobos.[/b][/color]

[color=#ff0000][b]This version of Chococraft will remove all Chocobos from worlds pre 2.8.5.  Items in the Chocobo saddlebag and packbag inventories will be lost. ChocoCraft items stored in normal chests or player inventories are not affected.[/b][/color]

crackedEggs parachute mod:
[spoiler]When flying a Chocobo, I would like to recommend the use of [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/77049-crackedegg/"]crackedEggs[/url] [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/585469-145forge-crackedeggs-mods-reptiles-parachute/"]parachute mod[/url] (version 410 or newer). Especially if you are using this mod on a server. On a connection failure while flying on high altitude, you will automatically dismount and fall to your death. One of crackedEggs parachutes in any spot in your inventory will auto-deploy if you're falling and thus prevent any harm from falling damage. (has to be switched on in the respective config file).[/spoiler]

Chocobos and their behaviour:
[spoiler]Types of Chocobos:
[spoiler]There are currently 9 types of Chocobos:
Yellow, Green, Blue, Black, White, Gold, Pink, Red and Purple

[img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/chocobo_colours_org.png[/img]
Picture by [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/524192-uncletravis/"]uncletravis[/url]

The average Chocobos are yellow, so all the wild ones you'll encounter will be of this type. Chocobos can be found in forests, plains and mountains (including snowy forests and mountains).
The other types can be obtained by breeding.

There are also rumors of there being 3 secret types.  [img]http://static.minecraftforum.net//public/style_emoticons/default/rolleyes.gif[/img]
[spoiler][img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/chocobo_pink_red.png[/img]
Screenshot by [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/524192-uncletravis/"]uncletravis[/url][/spoiler][/spoiler]

What's the difference between each type of Chocobo?
[spoiler]   1. Yellow Chocobos are the average chocobos and have no clear abilities.
   2. Green Chocobos have the ability to climb, which means that they don't need to jump in order to go up a block that is one step higher.
   3. Blue Chocobos have the ability to cross water, which means that they don't won't sink in water and will travel fast in water.
   4. White Chocobos have the ability to climb and cross water, and are faster than the previous ones.
   5. Black Chocobos have the ability to jump high, climb and cross water, and are as fast as the white ones.
   6. Gold/Pink/Red Chocobos have the ability to fly, climb and cross water, don't take fall damage, and are the fastest chocobos.
   7. Purple Chocobos have the ability to fly, climb and cross lava, don't take fall damage, are as fast as white and black chocobos, and are immune to fire. They will be found only in The Nether or End.
[/spoiler]

Where can I find Gysahl Greens?
[spoiler][img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/pic_gysahl_in_wild.png[/img]

   1. Gysahl Greens can be found around the world, in places where flowers can grow (mainly forests, plains and mountains)
   2. You can also craft Gysahl Seeds to plant in your farm.
   3. For the seeds to grow instantly, you can use Chocobo Fertilizer
[/spoiler]

How to obtain a Chocopedia?

[/spoiler]

How can I obtain a Chocobo Feather?
[spoiler]   1. Chocobo Feathers are occasionally dropped by wild or tamed Chocobos.
[/spoiler]

How can I obtain Loverly or Golden Gysahls?
[spoiler]   1. Obtain wild Gysahl Greens
   2. craft Gysahl seeds from Gysahl Greens and plant them in tilted earth
   3. wait for the Gysahl to fully grow
   4. harvest Gysahl. Loverly and Golden Gysahls are a domestic mutation of Gysahl Greens. Thus, when harvesting your planted Gysahls, you will notice if the plant has grown into a Loverly or Golden Gysahl. Unfortunately Loverly and Golden Gysahl are infertile, thus they do not contain any seeds and can not be crafted into seeds, their only purpose is to work as an aphrodisiac for Chocobos.
[/spoiler]

How can I breed two Chocobos?
[spoiler][img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/pic_chocobo_hearts.png[/img]
Screenshot by [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/524192-uncletravis/"]uncletravis[/url]

   1. First you have to obtain Loverly Gysahls or Golden Gysahls by farming. Both are a domestic mutation of the normal Gysahl Green.
   2. select two tamed Chocobos of different gender to be breed. You can only choose Chocobos you own.
   3. wait until the status in the Chocopedia changes from "can not breed" to "can breed". Chocobos need some time after breeding (and after growing up) to be ready to breed again.
   4. both Chocobos have to be fed Loverly Gysahls or Golden Gysahls. After that, they'll procreate and a Chicobo will born. There is a certain chance of breeding a mutation, thus a different colored Chocobo will be born.
   5. by feeding both Chocobos with Golden Gysahls, the probability of a mutation will increase noticeably.
[/spoiler]

When will a Chicobo grow into a Chocobo?
[spoiler][img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/pic_chocobo_chicobo.png[/img]

   1. Chicobos are young Chocobos, so after some time they will eventually grow up
   2. Chicobos can also be fed a Gysahl Cake to grow up instantly, but only after they have been tamed.
[/spoiler]

How can I get the other types of Chocobos?
[spoiler]I'll put a new spoiler tag on this, since these are the exact breeding instructions to get the other types. So be warned! If you want to experiment and find out about how to get the other types DO NOT READ THIS. You've been warned.

[spoiler]   1. Yellow + Yellow = Green or Blue
   2. Green + Blue = White
   3. Yellow + White = Black
   4. Black + White =(Golden Gysahls REQUIRED)= Gold

I won't tell you how to get the other two types anyway >[img]http://static.minecraftforum.net//public/style_emoticons/default/smile.png[/img] All I can say is it is not through breeding, but by forcing a Gold chocobo to be another one ;P[/spoiler][/spoiler]

And why do I want a Chocobo?

Items and Blocks:
[spoiler]   1. [img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/item_gysahl_green.png[/img] Gysahl Greens - Gysahl Greens are the most important block in ChocoCraft. They are used to tame Chocobos and to create various other greens. Just like flowers, Gysahl Greens will grow randomly across the map and can be collected and even planted again.
   2. [img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/item_choco_leg_raw.png[/img] Raw Chocobo Leg - This piece of meat is dropped by the most unfortunate Chocobos. Just like regular chicken legs, they can be cooked on a furnace.
   3. [img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/item_choco_leg_cooked.png[/img] Cooked Chocobo Leg - By eating this yummy chocobo leg, you'll reduce your famine. A Chocobo Leg reduces famine even more than a cooked chicken leg, healing just as much as a cooked pork chop.
   4. [img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/item_choco_feather.png[/img]Chocobo Feather - Chocobo Feathers are very attractive items to Chocobos. They can be used to build saddles, whistles, and even special types of gysahls. Tamed chocobos will occasionaly drop these.
   5. [img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/item_saddle.png[/img] Chocobo Saddle - Tamed Chocobos can only be ridden once they are saddled with these special saddles.
   6. [img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/item_saddle_bags.png[/img] Chocobo Saddle Bags - Saddled Chocobos can be equipted with one of these to give them some transport and storage capacities. Once saddle bags are fitted onto a Chocobo, they can be accessed by shift-right-clicking the Chocobo. (can be used on Chocobo, but inventories are disabled at the moment)
   7. [img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/item_choco_pack_bags.png[/img] Chocobo Pack Bags - Tamed Chocobos can be equipted with one of these to give them some transport and storage capacities.

   9. [img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/item_gysahl_loverly.png[/img] Loverly Gysahl - Loverly Gysahls are a special domestic mutation of Gysahl Greens. When growing Gysahl seeds in tilted earth, there is a chance the crop will grow into a Loverly Gysahl. This form of the plant does not appear in the wild. Loverly Gysahls are used to make a Chocobo fall in love and look for a partner to procreate.
10. [img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/item_gysahl_golden.png[/img] Golden Gysahl - Just like Loverly Gysahls, Golden Gysahls are used to make Chocobos procreate. Like Loverly Gysahls this is a domestic mutation of Gysahl Greens. These romantic herbs are known to increase the chances of adquiring a new type of Chocobo.
11. [img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/item_gysahl_cake.png[/img] Gysahl Cake - Chicobos just love gysahl greens and cakes, and when you join both, they're get really happy. Gysahl Cakes give joy to a Chicobo, making him grow up instantly into one big and beautiful Chocobo.
12. [img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/item_gysahl_rawpickles.png[/img] Raw Gysahl Pickles - First step towards some tasty cooked Gysahl pickles.
13. [img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/item_gysahl_pickles.png[/img] After cooking raw Gysahl pickles you will receive this tasty Gysahl pickles. It will not only taste marvelous, but also reduce your famine a little.
14. [img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/item_gysahl_pink.png[/img] Pink Gysahl - Weird synthetic gysahls are known to cause extreme effects to Chocobos. So beware.

17. [img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/item_chocopedia.png[/img] Chocopedia - Notebook that keeps information about the Chocobos. Allows player to name their chocobo, check on information about health and breeing status and even give orders.
18. [img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/item_straw.png[/img] Straw - Straw cover for a Chocobo pen.[/spoiler]

Known Issues and Bugs:
[spoiler]   1. Chocobos love to stare in the face of people. It's not as much dangerous as it is creepy.
If you happen to find any more bug or issue, please report it on this thread and I'll look into it ASAP [img]http://static.minecraftforum.net//public/style_emoticons/default/smile.png[/img] [/spoiler]

Config Files:
[spoiler] As of 1.4.1u, ChocoCraft allows you to customize the mod by editing the config file.

There are two config files, both located in the config folder in the main minecraft folder. One is called "chocobo_config.txt", the other one "ChocoCraft.cfg".

"ChocoCraft.cfg" will host the default values for item and block ids.

"chocobo_config.txt" will host all flags and settings regarding everything else of the ChocoCraft mod.

There are comments to describe the meaning and usage of the settings in "chocobo_config.txt" in the file itself. You can add your own comments by starting the respective line in the text with "//".

To reset the values and the comments, in case the config file has been updated by me or you have edited it beyond recognition, just delete the file and run minecraft once with the ChocoCraft mod active.

Since the entries involved with the Chocobo spawning are the most obscure, here a more detailed explanation to make it clear:
[list]
[*][b]spawnTimeDelay[/b] Default is 200, this is the time in minecraft-ticks between two attempts of the ChocoboSpawner to spawn wild Chocobos into the world.
[*][b]spawnProbability[/b] Default is 2, this is the probability out of 100 for each spawn attempt the ChocoboSpawner will actually try to spawn wild Chocobos into the world. So as default only 2% of the times a spawn attempt will be started.
[*][b]spawnGroupMin[/b] and [b]spawnGroupMax[/b] Default is 2 and 4. This limits the size of Chocobo flocks spawn in one attempt into the world.
[*][b]spawnTotalMax[/b] Default is 3, this is the max amount of active wild Chocobos, so if in the currently loaded Chunks three active wild Chocobos are around, there will be no further wild Chocobo spawning.
[*][b]spawnLimitChunkRadius[/b] Default is 100, this is the radius of blocks the Chocobos for the [b]spawnTotalMax [/b]limit are searched in.
[*][b]distanceNextWild[/b] Defaults to 300, this is the minimum distance between two wild Chocobo flocks. If a flock of Chocobos is less then 300 clicks away, there will be no further spawning.

How to Install:
[spoiler]1. Install the latest Forge by following the instructions found on the Forge page. The link can be found above the link to this mod near the top of this page.
2. With Forge installed, put the ChocoCraft .zip file in your minecraft "mods" folder (in zipped form, not extracted!).

controlling mod loading sequence:
[spoiler]Certain mods can interact with ChocoCraft, but you have to make sure they are loaded in the mod loading sequence before ChocoCraft. For example Chocobos can spawn in the biomes provided by the [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1090288-142-extrabiomesxl-330/page__hl__%20xlbiomes"]extrabiomesxl[/url] mod, if the respective names are added in the chocobo config file. But for that to work, the biomesxl mod has to be loaded before ChocoCraft by the Forge modloader.

Mods which are placed in the mods folder are loaded in alphabetic sequence according to their name. Thus, if you want to make sure a certain mod is loaded before another one, just add a number prefix to each mod filename in the mods folder, for example:

01_someMod.zip
02_someOtherMod.zip
03_Chococraft_2.1.4.zip

will have the mods loaded in the sequence someMod, someOtherMod, Chococraft. Whereas

01_Chococraft_2.1.4.zip
03_someOtherMod.zip
05_someMod.zip

will have the mods loaded in the sequence Chococraft, someOtherMod, someMod.
[/spoiler]
[/spoiler]

How to Install server version:
[spoiler]Chococraft version 2.0.4+ is needed

1. Install Forge v4.1.4.297 or newer into a minecraft server.
2. Run the server once. (And stop it again)
3. Put the Chococraft_x.x.x.zip into the mods folder in the server folder
4. run the server again. Now Clients with Chococraft_x.x.x.zip installed can connect to the server and enjoy riding Chocobos through the landscape.

 - Divine RPG (messing up forge mob id assignment 1.4.7)
 - Ars Magica (using multiple *bonemeal* events for the effect of growing multiple plants without actually using *bonemeal*, this will screw up the usage of the active player item 1.4.7)

2. Chocobos are creatures from Square Enix's Final Fantasy franchise, which later became main characters on their own games. As such, I do not own any right on them.

7. The old models of the Chocobos were HIGHLY inspired by the Moa creatures in The Aether Mod. If you don't know this mod, you should. Go get it ASAP.
8. The models of the Chicobos were HIGHLY inspired by the chicks present in Baby Animals Mod. If you don't know this mod, you should also go get it ASAP.

Modpacks:
[spoiler]Since I have been asked a few times for permission to add my mod to a mod-pack, here my general terms. If they are meet, you can send me a message asking for permission. If they are not meet, dont bother ...

- no money will be made from the download of the mod-pack (URL-shortener, click-counter etc...)
- Link to the ChocoCraft OP on www.minecraftforum.net will be provided in a text file included with the mod-pack (text file of mods list is sufficient)
- Link to the ChocoCraft OP will be provided on your community/server web page if available
- Modpack users will be informed about the latest version of ChocoCraft, thus I don't want to hear every to often about bugs fixed in the current official version, but not in the pack version.
- I can revoke my permission any time (which I don't intend to do unprovoked without the modpacker doing anything objectionable)
