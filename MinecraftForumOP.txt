UPDATED FOR MINECRAFT 1.4.2
Version 2.1.3
Requires: [url="http://www.minecraftforge.net/"]Forge[/url] [url="http://files.minecraftforge.net/"]6.0.1.332+[/url]

This Mod is the continuation of [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/1051245-eddiev/"]EddieV's[/url] mod. The original thread can be found [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/952372-chococraft-12-mc-11-chocobos-now-fly/"]here[/url]. I've officially taken over the helm with Eddie's kind blessings.

This mod adds a mob called Chocobo to the game. This includes different coloured mob types with different attributes in their grown-up and juvenile form.

The most basic type can be found in the wild and can be tamed by using "Gysahl Greens" on them. Gysahl Greens is a plant found in the wild, but also can be planted by sowing Gysahl Seeds. Gysahl Seeds can be received by crafting from Gysahl Greens or by harvesting planted Gysahl Greens.

Chocobos can be breed and procreate. The offspring will be a Chicobo, the juvenile form of a Chocobo. After a while a Chicobo will grow into a Chocobo. Chicobos will be born wild and have to be tamed. Chicobos will inherit the type from one of their parents or mutate into new types. Thus by repeatedly breeding Chocobos all normal types of Chocobos can be acquired from tamed wild Chocobos. There are a few special Chocobo types though, which can only be acquired by special means.

As of version 2.0.4 this mod is in working condition for SMP.

[color=#ff0000][b]ACHTUNG! CAUTION! ¡CUIDADO! चेतावनी! ATTENZIONE! береги́сь!
This version of Chococraft is not compatible to versions pre 2.0.0 (pre mc 1.3.2). It will destroy your saved world if old Chocobos are included. Thus, if you want to use an old world with the new version of this mod, you should first start minecraft without the Chococraft mod, enter and save your world, thus removing all traces of older versions of Chococraft and only then start minecraft with the new version of Chococraft and tame new Chocobos.[/b][/color]

Chocobos and their behaviour:
[spoiler]Types of Chocobos:
[spoiler]There are currently 9 types of Chocobos:
Yellow, Green, Blue, Black, White, Gold, Pink, Red and Purple

[img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/chocobo_colours.png[/img]
Picture by [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/524192-uncletravis/"]uncletravis[/url]

The average Chocobos are yellow, so all the wild ones you'll encounter will be of this type. Chocobos can be found in forests, plains and mountains (including snowy forests and mountains).
The other types can be obtained by breeding.

There are also rumors of there being 3 secret types.  [img]http://static.minecraftforum.net//public/style_emoticons/default/rolleyes.gif[/img]

What's the difference between each type of Chocobo?
[spoiler]
   1. Yellow Chocobos are the average chocobos and have no clear abilities.
   2. Green Chocobos have the ability to climb, which means that they don't need to jump in order to go up a block that is one step higher.
   3. Blue Chocobos have the ability to cross water, which means that they don't won't sink in water and will travel fast in water.
   4. White Chocobos have the ability to climb and cross water, and are faster than the previous ones.
   5. Black Chocobos have the ability to jump high, climb and cross water, and are as fast as the white ones.
   6. Gold/Pink/Red Chocobos have the ability to fly, climb and cross water, don't take fall damage, and are the fastest chocobos.
   7. (Purple Chocobos have the ability to fly, climb and cross lava, don't take fall damage, are as fast as white and black chocobos, and are immune to fire. They will be found only in The Nether.) Not available at the moment.
[/spoiler]

Where can I find Gysahl Greens?
[spoiler][img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/pic_gysahl_in_wild.png[/img]

   1. Gysahl Greens can be found around the world, in places where flowers can grow (mainly forests, plains and mountains)
   2. You can also craft Gysahl Seeds to plant in your farm.
   3. For the seeds to grow instantly, you can use Chocobo Fertilizer
[/spoiler]

How do I tame a Chocobo?
[spoiler][img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/pic_choco_in_wild.png[/img]

   1. find a pack of wild Chocobos
   2. Feed one some Gysahl Greens
   3. You will see some hearts and a red collar when the Chocobo is tamed
[/spoiler]

What happens when a Chocobo is tamed?
[spoiler]
   1. you can use the Chocopedia on it
   2. the Chocobo can be saddled using a Chocobo Saddle.
   3. can be made to follow its owner with help of the Chocopedia or a right click with a feather. (Default after taming is not following)
   4. can be healed using Gysahl Greens
   (5. can be equipted with a transport pack)

[/spoiler]

[spoiler]
    1. the Chocobo can store and transport up to 36 item stacks. Saddle bags can be accessed by shift-right-click.
    2. can drop saddle and saddle bags by clicking on "drop gear" in Chocopedia

[/spoiler]

How can I obtain a Chocobo Feather?
[spoiler]
   1. Chocobo Feathers are occasionally dropped by wild or tamed Chocobos.
[/spoiler]

How can I breed two Chocobos?
[spoiler][img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/pic_chocobo_hearts.png[/img]
Screenshot by [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/524192-uncletravis/"]uncletravis[/url]

   1. select two tamed Chocobos of different gender to be breed. You can only choose Chocobos you own.
   2. wait until the status in the Chocopedia changes from "can not breed" to "can breed". Chocobos need some time after breeding (and after growing up) to be ready to breed again.
   3. both Chocobos have to be fed Loverly Gysahls or Golden Gysahls. After that, they'll procreate and a Chicobo will born. There is a certain chance of breeding a mutation, thus a different colored Chocobo will be born.
   4. by feeding both Chocobos with Golden Gysahls, the probability of a mutation will increase noticeably.
[/spoiler]

When will a Chicobo grow into a Chocobo?
[spoiler][img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/pic_chocobo_chicobo.png[/img]

   1. Chicobos are young Chocobos, so after some time they will eventually grow up
   2. Chicobos can also be fed a Gysahl Cake to grow up instantly, but only after they have been tamed.
   3. Chicobos can also be fed a Chibi Gysahl to remain as Chicobos. After this, a Chicobo will only grow up when fed a Gysahl Cake.
[/spoiler]

How can I get the other types of Chocobos?
[spoiler]I'll put a new spoiler tag on this, since these are the exact breeding instructions to get the other types. So be warned! If you want to experiment and find out about how to get the other types DO NOT READ THIS. You've been warned.

[spoiler]
   1. Yellow + Yellow = Green or Blue
   2. Green + Blue = White
   3. Yellow + White = Black
   4. Black + White =(Golden Gysahls REQUIRED)= Gold

I won't tell you how to get the other two types anyway >[img]http://static.minecraftforum.net//public/style_emoticons/default/smile.png[/img] All I can say is it is not through breeding, but by forcing a Gold chocobo to be another one ;P[/spoiler][/spoiler]

And why do I want a Chocobo?

11. [img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/item_gysahl_cake.png[/img] Gysahl Cake - Chicobos just love gysahl greens and cakes, and when you join both, they're get really happy. Gysahl Cakes give joy to a Chicobo, making him grow up instantly into one big and beautiful Chocobo.

NOTES:

Known Issues and Bugs:
[spoiler]
   1. Chocobos love to stare in the face of people. It's not as much dangerous as it is creepy.
   2. Inventory not working yet.
   3. While traveling on Chocobo, Chocobo model will twitch left and right.
If you happen to find any more bug or issue, please report it on this thread and I'll look into it ASAP [img]http://static.minecraftforum.net//public/style_emoticons/default/smile.png[/img] [/spoiler]

Config File (not available at the moment):
[spoiler] As of 1.4.1u, ChocoCraft allows you to customize the mod by editing the config file.
For example, you can change item IDs to solve conflicts, change the maximum number of Chocobos and choose whether to hide or show the name of the chocobos above their head.
Here's how to do it:
   1. You can find the config file in your main minecraft folder and it's called "chocobo_config.txt".
   2. Open it with Notepad or any other text editor
   3. Lines that start with "//" are comment lines.
   4. Change any entry according to the description in the config file.

For any other mod developer, or people that want to change other mod's ids and not these, here are the IDs that I use:
1551 for the block of Gysahl Greens
1552 for the Gysahl crops
22601-22620 for the items
[/spoiler]

Ideas for Future Development:
[spoiler]
  1. Special Gui when riding Chocobo that will show his current health and name
  2. Chocobos to attack enemies of the owner, much like wolves do
  3. Chocobo music when riding
  4. Randomize Chocobo heights
  5. Yellow Chocobo spawn eggs
  6. FFX hot & cold
  7. dynamic abilities (???)
  8. idle animation for saddled and waiting Chocobos
  9. make genders disable-able from config-file
 10. maybe: item to increase spawn rate when equipped or Chocobo-seeker item
 11. maybe: double wide chocobo fence doors
 12. maybe: eat grass for time to be able to breed bonus
If you have any more suggestions, comments or ideas, keep 'em coming [img]http://static.minecraftforum.net//public/style_emoticons/default/smile.png[/img][/spoiler]

How to Install:
[spoiler]
1. Install Forge v4.1.4.297 or newer by following the instructions on the corresponding pages. The link to both can be found above the link to this mod.
2. With Forge installed, put this mod's .zip file in your minecraft "mods" folder.
3. Extract the mod zip in a different folder and get the file choco_kweh.ogg from /resources/sounds and put it into the folder minecraft/resources/mod/. (The other extracted files from the zip won't be needed anymore and can be deleted. Do not delete the zip in the minecraft/mods folder, or if you have extracted the files into the minecraft/mods folder delete them after extracting the sound file. In the minecraft/mods folder only the chococraft_x.x.x_zip file should stay.)
[/spoiler]

How to Install server version:
[spoiler]Chococraft version 2.0.4+ is needed

1. Install Forge v4.1.4.297 or newer into a minecraft server.
2. Run the server once. (And stop it again)
3. Put the Chococraft_x.x.x.zip into the mods folder in the server folder
4. run the server again. Now Clients with Chococraft_x.x.x.zip installed can connect to the server and enjoy riding Chocobos through the landscape.

1. Chococraft has been created by [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/1051245-eddiev/"]EddieV[/url]
2. Chocobos are creatures from Square Enix's Final Fantasy franchise, which later became main characters on their own games. As such, I do not own any right on them.
3. The design of the new Chocobo model has been created by [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/758250-firas333/"]firas333[/url].
4. Pictures of new Chocobos made by [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/524192-uncletravis/"]uncletravis[/url] and [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/1099767-poloniumradon/"]PoloniumRadon[/url].
5. The old models of the Chocobos were HIGHLY inspired by the Moa creatures in The Aether Mod. If you don't know this mod, you should. Go get it ASAP.
6. The models of the Chicobos were HIGHLY inspired by the chicks present in Baby Animals Mod. If you don't know this mod, you should also go get it ASAP.
