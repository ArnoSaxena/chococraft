UPDATED FOR MINECRAFT 1.3.2
Version 2.0.3b
Requires: [url="http://www.minecraftforge.net/"]Forge[/url] [url="http://files.minecraftforge.net/"]4.1.4.297+[/url]

This Mod is the continuation of [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/1051245-eddiev/"]EddieV's[/url] mod. The original thread can be found [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/952372-chococraft-12-mc-11-chocobos-now-fly/"]here[/url]. I've officially taken over the helm with Eddie's kind blessings.

This mod adds a mob called Chocobo to the game. This includes different coloured mob types with different attributes in their grown-up and juvenile form.

The most basic type can be found in the wild and can be tamed by using "Gysahl Greens" on them. Gysahl Greens is a plant found in the wild, but also can be planted by sowing Gysahl Seeds. Gysahl Seeds can be received by crafting from Gysahl Greens or by harvesting planted Gysahl Greens.

Chocobos can be breed and procreate. The offspring will be a Chicobo, the juvenile form of a Chocobo. After a while a Chicobo will grow into a Chocobo. Chicobos will be born wild and have to be tamed. Chicobos will inherit the type from one of their parents or mutate into new types. Thus by repeatedly breeding Chocobos all normal types of Chocobos can be acquired from tamed wild Chocobos. There are a few special Chocobo types though, which can only be acquired by special means.


[color=#ff0000][b]ACHTUNG! CAUTION! ¡CUIDADO! चेतावनी! ATTENZIONE! береги́сь!
This version of Chococraft is not compatible to versions pre 2.0.0 (pre mc 1.3.2). It will destroy your saved world if old Chocobos are included. Thus, if you want to use an old world with the new version of this mod, you should first start minecraft without the Chococraft mod, enter and save your world, thus removing all traces of older versions of Chococraft and only then start minecraft with the new version of Chococraft and tame new Chocobos.[/b][/color]

Chocobos and their behaviour:

[spoiler]There are currently 9 types of Chocobos:
Yellow, Green, Blue, Black, White, Gold, Pink, Red and Purple

[img]http://www.arno-saxena.de/pictures/chococraft/chocobo_colours.png[/img]

The average Chocobos are yellow, so all the wild ones you'll encounter will be of this type. Chocobos can be found in forests, plains and mountains (including snowy forests and mountains).
The other types can be obtained by breeding.

There are also rumors of there being 3 secret types.  [img]http://static.minecraftforum.net//public/style_emoticons/default/rolleyes.gif[/img]

[/spoiler]

What's the difference between each type of Chocobo?
[spoiler]
   1. Yellow Chocobos are the average chocobos and have no clear abilities.
   2. Green Chocobos have the ability to climb, which means that they don't need to jump in order to go up a block that is one step higher.
   3. Blue Chocobos have the ability to cross water, which means that they don't won't sink in water and will travel fast in water.
   4. White Chocobos have the ability to climb and cross water, and are faster than the previous ones.
   5. Black Chocobos have the ability to jump high, climb and cross water, and are as fast as the white ones.
   6. Gold/Pink/Red Chocobos have the ability to fly, climb and cross water, don't take fall damage, and are the fastest chocobos.
   7. (Purple Chocobos have the ability to fly, climb and cross lava, don't take fall damage, are as fast as white and black chocobos, and are immune to fire. They will be found only in The Nether.) Not available at the moment.

   1. both Chocobos have to be fed Loverly Gysahls or Golden Gysahls. After that, they'll procreate and a Chicobo will born. You'll have 25% chance of breeding a mutation, i.e, of a chocobo of a new type to be born.
   2. by feeding both Chocobos with Golden Gysahls, the probability of a mutation will increase to 50%.

[/spoiler]

[spoiler]
I'll put a new spoiler tag on this, since these are the exact breeding instructions to get the other types. So be warned! If you want to experiment and find out about how to get the other types DO NOT READ THIS. You've been warned.

[spoiler]

   4. Black + White =(Golden Gysahls REQUIRED)= Gold

I won't tell you how to get the other two types anyway >[img]http://static.minecraftforum.net//public/style_emoticons/default/smile.png[/img] All I can say is it is not through breeding, but by forcing a Gold chocobo to be another one ;P[/spoiler]
[/spoiler]

NOTES:

Known Issues and Bugs:
[spoiler]
   1. Chocobos love to stare in the face of people. It's not as much dangerous as it is creepy.
   2. Inventory not working yet.
   3. While traveling on Chocobo, Chocobo model will twitch left and right.
If you happen to find any more bug or issue, please report it on this thread and I'll look into it ASAP [img]http://static.minecraftforum.net//public/style_emoticons/default/smile.png[/img] [/spoiler]

Config File (not available at the moment):
[spoiler] As of 1.4.1u, ChocoCraft allows you to customize the mod by editing the config file.
For example, you can change item IDs to solve conflicts, change the maximum number of Chocobos and choose whether to hide or show the name of the chocobos above their head.
Here's how to do it:
   1. You can find the config file in your main minecraft folder and it's called "chocobo_config.txt".
   2. Open it with Notepad or any other text editor
   3. Lines that start with "//" are comment lines.
   4. Change any entry according to the description in the config file.

For any other mod developer, or people that want to change other mod's ids and not these, here are the IDs that I use:
1551 for the block of Gysahl Greens
1552 for the Gysahl crops
22601-22620 for the items
[/spoiler]

Ideas for Future Development:
[spoiler]
  1. Special Gui when riding Chocobo that will show his current health and name
  2. Chocobos to attack enemies of the owner, much like wolves do
  3. Chocobo music when riding
  4. Randomize Chocobo heights
  5. Yellow Chocobo spawn eggs
  6. FFX hot & cold
  7. dynamic abilities (???)
  8. idle animation for saddled and waiting Chocobos
  9. make genders disable-able from config-file
 10. maybe: item to increase spawn rate when equipped or Chocobo-seeker item
 11. maybe: double wide chocobo fence doors
 12. maybe: eat grass for time to be able to breed bonus
If you have any more suggestions, comments or ideas, keep 'em coming [img]http://static.minecraftforum.net//public/style_emoticons/default/smile.png[/img][/spoiler]

How to Install:
[spoiler]
1. Install Forge v4.1.4.297 or newer by following the instructions on the corresponding pages. The link to both can be found above the link to this mod.
2. With Forge installed, put this mod's .zip file in your minecraft "mods" folder.
3. Extract the mod zip in a different folder and get the file choco_kweh.ogg from /resources/sounds and put it into the folder minecraft/resources/mod/. (The other extracted files from the zip won't be needed anymore and can be deleted. Do not delete the zip in the minecraft/mods folder, or if you have extracted the files into the minecraft/mods folder delete them after extracting the sound file. In the minecraft/mods folder only the chococraft_x.x.x_zip file should stay.)

2. Chocobos are creatures from Square Enix's Final Fantasy franchise, which later became main characters on their own games. As such, I do not own any right on them.
3. The design of the new Chocobo model has been created by [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/758250-firas333/"]firas333[/url].

5. The old models of the Chocobos were HIGHLY inspired by the Moa creatures in The Aether Mod. If you don't know this mod, you should. Go get it ASAP.
6. The models of the Chicobos were HIGHLY inspired by the chicks present in Baby Animals Mod. If you don't know this mod, you should also go get it ASAP.
