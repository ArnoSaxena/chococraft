This is the official Chococraft version 1.6.11 for usage with minecraft 1.2.5. Chococraft has been created by EddieV and is now officially maintained by Torojima.

This version (1.6.11) has modified the config file, so if you had run an older version of Chococraft before, the old config file should be deleted so this mod can create a new one.

Changelog:
1. added Genders and different names and skins for males and females. Now breeding has to be done between two Chocobos with different gender.
2. moved Chocobo entity classes to be derived from EntityAnimal rather than from EntityCreature.
3. removed buggy "feature" where Chocobos will follow a player with loverly Ghysal equipped in active slot (and do not stop following even after loverly Ghysal is unequipped).
4. removed Chocobo tweezers.
5. reorganised skin folder
6. non-swimming Chocobos will sink very slow when in deep water to give the owner time to rescue it.
