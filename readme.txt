This is the official Chococraft version 1.6.9 for usage with minecraft 1.2.5. Chococraft has been created by EddieV and is now officially maintained by Torojima.

This version (1.6.9) has modified the config file, so if you had run an older version of Chococraft before, the old config file should be deleted so this mod can create a new one.

Changelog:
1. removed a bug in the nomenclature of one of the config file entries, pawnMinGroup will now be known as spawnMinGroup :D
2. added pack Chocobos with bigger inventory, but can not be used as mount.
3. added entries for spawn time cycle and spawn threshold to the config file
