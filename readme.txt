This is the official version of Torojimas Chococraft v2.8.6 for usage with minecraft 1.5.2. Chococraft has been originally created by EddieV and is now refactored and officially maintained by Torojima.

This mod adds a mob called Chocobo to the game. This includes different coloured mob types with different attributes in their grown-up and juvenile form.

The most basic type can be found in the wild and can be tamed by using "Gysahl Greens" on them. Gysahl Greens is a plant found in the wild, but also can be planted by sowing Gysahl Seeds. Gysahl Seeds can be received by crafting from Gysahl Greens or by harvesting planted Gysahl Greens.

Chocobos can be breed and procreate. The offspring will be a Chicobo, the juvenile form of a Chocobo. After a while a Chicobo will grow into a Chocobo. Chicobos will be born wild and have to be tamed. Chicobos will inherit the type from one of their parents or mutate into new types. Thus by repeatedly breeding Chocobos all normal types of Chocobos can be acquired from tamed wild Chocobos. There are a few special Chocobo types though, which can only be acquired by special means.

ACHTUNG! CAUTION! ¡CUIDADO! चेतावनी! ATTENZIONE! береги́сь!
This version of Chococraft is not compatible to versions pre 1.3.2. It will destroy your saved world if old Chocobos are included. Thus, if you want to use an old world with the new version of this mod, you should first start minecraft without the Chococraft mod, enter and save your world, thus removing all traces of older versions of Chococraft and only then start minecraft with the new version of Chococraft and tame new Chocobos.

This version of Chococraft will remove all Chocobos from worlds pre 2.8.5.  Items in the Chocobo saddlebag and packbag inventories will be lost. ChocoCraft items stored in normal chests or player inventories are not affected.

Changelog:
1. changed gysahl mutation rate from procent to permille. (default values are äquivalent to the values before)
2. changed the straw recipe from shapeless one wheat to four straw mats to two wheat next to each other for eight straw mats.
3. added Chocopedia creation through use of Chocobo feather on bookshelf.
4. added Chocopedia creation through use of writable book on chocobo;
