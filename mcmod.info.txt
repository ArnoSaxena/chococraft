  "description": "This is the official version of Torojimas Chococraft 1.8.1 for usage with minecraft 1.3.2. Chococraft has been originally created by EddieV and is now officially maintained by Torojima.\n\nThis mod adds a mob called Chocobo to the game. This includes different coloured mob types with different attributes in their grown-up and juvenile form.\n\nThe most basic type can be found in the wild and can be tamed by using "Gysahl Greens" on them.\n\nGysahl Greens is plant found in the wild, wich can be planted by sowing Gysahl Seeds. Gysahl Seeds can be received by crafting Gysahl Greens or by harvesting planted Gysahl Greens.\n\nChocobos can be breed thus and procreate. The offspring will be a Chicobo, the juvenile form of a Chocobo. After a while a Chicobo will grow into a Chocobo. Chicobos will be born wild and have to be tamed.\n\nChicobos will inherit the type from one of their parents and even mutate into new better types. Thus by repeatedly breeding Chocobos all normal types of Chocobos can be acquired. There are a few special Chocobo types though, which can only be acquired by special means.",
